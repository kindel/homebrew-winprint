# Template rendered by the release pipeline (release.yml -> brew job) and pushed to the
# kindel/homebrew-winprint tap. Placeholders are filled with each stable release's version,
# download base URL, and per-arch SHA256s. This is the free MAUI GUI (WinPrint.app),
# distributed directly (NOT the App Store). The app is signed with an Apple Developer ID and
# notarized + stapled by the release pipeline (the APPLE_* secrets are configured), so Gatekeeper
# accepts it without a quarantine workaround.
#
# The GUI bundle ALSO embeds the `wp` TUI (release.yml copies the self-contained CLI payload into
# WinPrint.app/Contents/Helpers/wp), so this single cask install delivers BOTH the GUI and the `wp`
# command — the `binary` stanza below symlinks the embedded wp onto PATH. `brew install winprint`
# therefore installs everything a Mac user needs. The CLI-only `wp` *formula* still ships for Linux
# and headless macOS; it also provides `wp`, so installing the cask AND the formula collides on the
# `wp` symlink (Homebrew errors at link time) — pick one on macOS. (Casks can't declare a
# `conflicts_with formula:`; that key is cask-only, so we just document it here.)
